# Electron File Download Manager

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/electron-dl-manager.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-dl-manager) [![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%2F%3E-TypeScript-%230074c1.svg)](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

A simple and easy to use file download manager for Electron applications.
Designed in response to the many issues around `electron-dl` and provides
a more robust and reliable solution for downloading files in Electron.

Use cases:

- Download files from a URL
- Get an id associated with the download to track it
- Optionally show a "Save As" dialog
- Get progress updates on the download
- Be able to cancel / pause / resume downloads
- Support multiple downloads at once

Electron 26.0.0 or later is required.

```typescript
// In main process
// Not a working example, just a demonstration of the API
import { ElectronDownloadManager } from 'electron-dl-manager';

const manager = new ElectronDownloadManager();

// Start a download
const id = await manager.download({
  window: browserWindowInstance,
  url: 'https://example.com/file.zip',
  saveDialogOptions: {
    title: 'Save File',
  },
  callbacks: {
    onDownloadStarted: async ({ id, item, webContents }) => {
      // Do something with the download id
    },
    onDownloadProgress: async (...) => {},
    onDownloadCompleted: async (...) => {},
    onDownloadCancelled: async (...) => {},
    onDownloadInterrupted: async (...) => {},
    onError: (err, data) => {},
  }
});

manager.cancelDownload(id);
manager.pauseDownload(id);
manager.resumeDownload(id);
```

# Installation

```bash
$ npm install electron-dl-manager
```

# Getting started

You'll want to use `electron-dl-manager` in the main process of your
Electron application where you will be handling the file downloads.

In this example, we use [IPC handlers / invokers](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc#pattern-2-renderer-to-main-two-way)
to communicate between the main and renderer processes, but you can
use any IPC strategy you want.

```typescript
// MainIpcHandlers.ts

import { ElectronDownloadManager } from 'electron-dl-manager';
import { ipcMain } from 'electron';

const manager = new ElectronDownloadManager();

// Renderer would invoke this handler to start a download
ipcMain.handle('download-file', async (event, args) => {
  const { url } = args;

  let downloadId
  const browserWindow = BrowserWindow.fromId(event.sender.id)

  // You *must* call manager.download() with await or 
  // you may get unexpected behavior
  downloadId = await manager.download({
    window: browserWindow,
    url,
    // If you want to download without a save as dialog
    saveAsFilename: 'file.zip',
    directory: '/directory/where/to/save',
    // If you want to download with a save as dialog
    saveDialogOptions: {
      title: 'Save File',
    },
    callbacks: {
      // item is an instance of Electron.DownloadItem
      onDownloadStarted: async ({ id, item, resolvedFilename }) => {
        // Send the download id back to the renderer along
        // with some other data
        browserWindow.webContents.invoke('download-started', {
          id,
          // The filename that the file will be saved as
          filename: resolvedFilename,
          // Get the file size to be downloaded in bytes
          totalBytes: item.getTotalBytes(),
        });
      },
      onDownloadProgress: async ({ id, item, percentCompleted }) => {
        // Send the download progress back to the renderer
        browserWindow.webContents.invoke('download-progress', {
          id,
          percentCompleted,
          // Get the number of bytes received so far
          bytesReceived: item.getReceivedBytes(),
        });
      },
      onDownloadCompleted: async ({ id, item }) => {
        // Send the download completion back to the renderer
        browserWindow.webContents.invoke('download-completed', {
          id,
          // Get the path to the file that was downloaded
          filePath: item.getSavePath(),
        });
      },
      onError: (err, data) => {
        // ... handle any errors
      }
    }
  });

  // Pause the download
  manager.pauseDownload(downloadId);
});
```

# API

   * this will be called after the user has selected a location.
   *
   * This will always be called first before the progress and completed events.
   */
  onDownloadStarted: (data: DownloadData) => void
  /**
   * When there is a progress update on a download. Note: This
   * may be skipped entirely in some cases, where the download
   * completes immediately. In that case, onDownloadCompleted
   * will be called instead.
   */
  onDownloadProgress: (data: DownloadData) => void
  /**
   * When the download has completed
   */
  onDownloadCompleted: (data: DownloadData) => void
  /**
   * When the download has been cancelled. Also called if the user cancels
   * from the save as dialog.
   */
  onDownloadCancelled: (data: DownloadData) => void
  /**
   * When the download has been interrupted. This could be due to a bad
   * connection, the server going down, etc.
   */
  onDownloadInterrupted: (data: DownloadData) => void
  /**
   * When an error has been encountered.
   * Note: The signature is (error, <maybe some data>).

   * will also be true if the download was cancelled by the application when
   * using the save as dialog.
   */
  cancelledFromSaveAsDialog?: boolean
  /**
   * The percentage of the download that has been completed
   */
  percentCompleted: number
  /**

  /**
   * If the download was interrupted, the state in which it was interrupted from

  interruptedVia?: 'in-progress' | 'completed'
}
```

#### Formatting download progress

You can use the libraries [`bytes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes) and [`dayjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs) to format the download progress.

```bash
$ npm install bytes dayjs
$ npm install @types/bytes --save-dev
```

```typescript
import bytes from 'bytes'
import dayjs from 'dayjs'
import relativeTime from 'dayjs/plugin/relativeTime';
import duration from 'dayjs/plugin/duration';

dayjs.extend(relativeTime);
dayjs.extend(duration);

const downloadData = manager.getDownloadData(id); // or DataItem from the callbacks

// Will return something like 1.2 MB/s
const formattedDownloadRate = bytes(downloadData.downloadRateBytesPerSecond, { unitSeparator: ' ' }) + '/s'

// Will return something like "in a few seconds"
const formattedEstimatedTimeRemaining = dayjs.duration(downloadData.estimatedTimeRemainingSeconds, 'seconds').humanize(true)
```

### `isDownloadInProgress()`

Returns true if the download is in progress.

```typescript
isDownloadInProgress(): boolean
```

### `isDownloadPaused()`

Returns true if the download is paused.

```typescript
isDownloadPaused(): boolean
```

### `isDownloadResumable()`

Returns true if the download is resumable.

```typescript
isDownloadResumable(): boolean
```

### `isDownloadCancelled()`

Returns true if the download is cancelled.

```typescript 
isDownloadCancelled(): boolean
```

### `isDownloadInterrupted()`

Returns true if the download is interrupted.

```typescript
isDownloadInterrupted(): boolean
```

### `isDownloadCompleted()`

Returns true if the download is completed.

```typescript
isDownloadCompleted(): boolean
```

# Mock class

If you need to mock out `ElectronDownloadManager` in your tests, you can use the `ElectronDownloadManagerMock` class.

`import { ElectronDownloadManagerMock } from 'electron-dl-manager'`

# FAQ

## How do I capture if the download is invalid? `onError()` is not being called.

Electron doesn't provide an explicit way to capture errors for downloads in general.
What it does for invalid URLs, it will trigger the `onDownloadCancelled()` callback.

```typescript
const id = await manager.download({
  window: mainWindow,
  url: 'https://alkjsdflksjdflk.com/file.zip',
  callbacks: {
    onDownloadCancelled: async (...) => {
      // Invalid download; this callback will be called
    },
  }
});
```

A better way to handle this is to check if the URL exists prior to the download yourself.
I couldn't find a library that I felt was reliable to include into this package,
so it's best you find a library that works for you:

- https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=url%20exists&ranking=maintenance

GPT also suggests the following code (untested):

```typescript
async function urlExists(url: string): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { method: 'HEAD' });
    return response.ok;
  } catch (error) {
    return false;
  }
}

const exists = await urlExists('https://example.com/file.jpg');
```
